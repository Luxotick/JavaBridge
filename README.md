# JavaBridge

JavaBridge is my first Rust project focused on managing Java versions, executing JAR files, and handling configurations. This tool simplifies launching JAR files with your preferred Java version by automatically detecting installed Java environments on your system.

Key Features:

- Automatic detection and listing of installed Java versions.
- Seamless execution of JAR files with the selected Java version.
- Straightforward configuration management.

JavaBridge combines Rust's capabilities with Java's versatility to provide a reliable solution for Java development tasks.

Since this project is still in its early stages, I am open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to contribute to the project or share your thoughts on how to improve it.

## Installation
Clone repository and run the following command:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
Double-click the executable file or set the exe file as the default program for JAR files.
